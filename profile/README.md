Nowadays, many people keep pets such as dogs and cats. However, sometimes itâ€™s difficult to distinguish and identify the breed of one cat or dog to another. Especially for those who are not familiar with them. Therefore, an application is needed to help users identify different breeds of cats and dogs quickly and accurately. Not only identifying, but also how to care and what food is best for their lovely pets.


## Machine Learning Development Documentation
We use a dataset with 10 most popular dog breeds and 10 most popular cat breeds based on research in Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, and the world. The image data resource is taken from :
* https://www.kaggle.com/zippyz/cats-and-dogs-breeds-classification-oxford-dataset
* https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/stanford-dogs-dataset
* https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ma7555/cat-breeds-dataset

Here is the Dataset Link that we have processed :
